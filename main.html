	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount 
		of time it takes for each statement to complete. The less time an algorithm takes, the more efficient the algorithm</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.
	O(n) â€” Linear Space: The algorithm's memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
